            <remarks>If you want to take a screenshot of the screen and convert it into a GDI bitmap, use <b><see cref="M:Ensoftener.Global.GetScreenCPURead(SharpDX.Direct2D1.DeviceContext,System.Nullable{SharpDX.Rectangle},System.Nullable{SharpDX.Point})"/></b> on this context
            for the fastest performance. If you were to convert any context from <b><see cref="P:Ensoftener.Global.Setups"/></b> to GDI, it would take much longer, as the other contexts use
            <b><see cref="F:SharpDX.DXGI.Format.R32G32B32A32_Float"/></b>. In that case, the library would cast every individual float from the screen to a byte,

            <remarks>Setting the tile size both to a small amount or a large amount has disadvantages. Since texture coordinates in shaders are determined by tiles,

            to true solves this issue, but rendering shaders will be slower, as the GPU tries to render the whole image at once.</remarks>
